# Sharelock: Digital Memory Preservation Platform

## Executive Summary

Sharelock is a digital memory preservation platform that allows users to create, store, and share personal time capsules containing various types of content. These capsules are securely sealed until a predetermined future date or event, at which point they're revealed to create meaningful, nostalgic experiences. The platform combines modern cloud storage with thoughtful user experience to transform how people preserve memories across time.

## Introduction

### Vision & Purpose

In an increasingly digital world, our memories, thoughts, and experiences are scattered across devices, platforms, and accounts. Sharelock provides a deliberate, intentional way to preserve specific moments for future rediscovery, creating bridges across time between our past and future selves, or between generations.

### Core Concept

Users create digital time capsules by uploading content (notes, images, links, videos), setting a reveal date, and "sealing" the capsule. The content remains securely stored but inaccessible until the designated time arrives, at which point it becomes viewable to the creator and any designated recipients.

### Capsule Creation

Users can create time capsules with:
- Basic information (title, description, category)
- Customizable content (notes, links, images, videos)
- Tagging system for organization
- Flexible reveal timing options
- Privacy settings (private, public, or shared)

### Reveal Mechanics

Time capsules are revealed through:
- Automatic reveal on a specified future date
- Post-mortem reveal option for legacy preservation
- Countdown timers for anticipation building
- Notification system for reveal alerts

### Privacy & Sharing

Users control their content with:
- Multiple visibility levels (private, public, shared)
- Selective sharing with specific individuals
- Encryption for private content
- Row-level security at the database layer

### Discovery & Exploration

The platform facilitates discovery through:
- Public capsule exploration
- Category-based browsing
- Tag-based search
- Featured capsule highlighting
